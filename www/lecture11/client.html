        <!--
            Socket.IO is a library that provides an API around web sockets.  It inserts
            a layer of abstraction between your code and the actual web sockets.  One major
            advantage of using it is that it handles the "proxy" issue (if the proxy refuses
            to upgrade an HTTP connection to a web socket connection, socket.io will
            use alternative means toc ommunicate.
